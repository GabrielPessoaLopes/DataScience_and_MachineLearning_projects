# Machine Learning – Data Science and Statistical Analysis
This repository contains the resources, datasets, and code related to the report “Machine Learning – Data Science and Statistical Analysis” (Gabriel Lopes, 2023).
The report explores statistical analysis, data preprocessing, and machine learning techniques using SPSS, Python (Jupyter Notebooks), and Orange 3.

# Report Contents
The report is structured into the following main sections:

## Introduction
Overview of descriptive, exploratory, and inferential data analysis.
Presentation of the software tools used (SPSS, Python, Orange).

## Descriptive Analysis (SPSS)
Data preparation, missing values, descriptive statistics, histograms, bar graphs, custom tables, and boxplots.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (SPSS)
Independence tests (Chi-squared, Fisher, Likelihood Ratio).
Association tests (Phi, Cramer’s V, Contingency Coefficient).
Crosstabs, correlation measures (Pearson, Spearman).

## Parametric and Non-parametric Tests
Normality tests, T-tests, One-way ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis with Python
